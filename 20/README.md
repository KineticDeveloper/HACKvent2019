# HV19.20 i want to play a game

Another binary `game` with `file` type:

    game: Intel amd64 COFF object file, no line number info, not stripped, 26 sections, symbol offset=0xb50, 99 symbols

Probably to be run under Linux.

As this is a reverse engineering exercise, I startup Ghidra to take a look at the code.
